# itos-cc

Code-quality measurements for TypeScript (and JavaScript), Python, Kotlin,
and Go, in one binary, with output meant for both people and coding agents.

> **Experimental.** This is a proof of concept: commands, output, file
> formats, and exit codes may change in any release.

The aim is for coding agents to use it through
[itos](https://github.com/donvargax/itos), to find out where code is risky
before and after they change it. [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md) lists what is planned
and what has not been verified.

| Command | Question it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `itos-cc crap` | Which functions are complex *and* under-tested? |
| `itos-cc dry` | Which functions are the same code with the names changed? |
| `itos-cc mutate` | Would the tests notice if this code were wrong? |
| `itos-cc scrap` | Which test files should an agent leave alone, table-drive, refactor, or split? |
| `itos-cc units` | What functions and methods do the tools see? |
| `itos-cc serve` | Live architecture graph for the viewer: what depends on what, and where is it risky? |

The ideas come from Robert C. Martin's
[crapper](https://github.com/unclebob/crapper),
[mutator](https://github.com/unclebob/mutator),
[dryer](https://github.com/unclebob/dryer), and
[scrap](https://github.com/unclebob/scrap). This is a separate
implementation in Go around one shared core, so every tool understands every
language the same way.

## Install

Download your platform's archive from the
[latest release](https://github.com/donvargax/itos-cc/releases/latest):
Linux (static) and macOS on amd64 and arm64, and Windows on amd64. Check it
against `checksums.txt` and put `itos-cc` on your `PATH`:

```bash
sha256sum --ignore-missing -c checksums.txt
tar -xzf itos-cc-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz itos-cc
itos-cc version
```

Or build it with Go, which needs cgo and a C compiler (tree-sitter is C):

```bash
go install github.com/donvargax/itos-cc/cmd/itos-cc@latest
```

## Build

Parsing uses tree-sitter, which needs cgo and a C compiler:

```bash
go build -o itos-cc ./cmd/itos-cc
go test ./...
```

Releases are built by CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on each platform's own
runner when a `vX.Y.Z` tag is pushed, after the tests pass on Linux, macOS,
and Windows. To cross-compile Linux and Windows binaries locally instead, use
[zig](https://ziglang.org) as the C compiler:

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 CC="zig cc -target aarch64-linux-musl" \
  go build -ldflags='-linkmode=external -extldflags=-static' -o itos-cc ./cmd/itos-cc
CGO_ENABLED=1 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CC="zig cc -target x86_64-windows-gnu" \
  go build -o itos-cc.exe ./cmd/itos-cc
```

macOS binaries need a macOS machine or CI runner: Go's macOS link step asks
for a system library zig does not ship.

## Use

Run from a project root. Paths are files, directories, or fragments of a
path (`itos-cc crap billing`); `--changed` selects what git reports as added
or modified. Every command takes `-h`.

Every tool works on the same units: functions and methods, plus inline
Express-style route callbacks (`app.get("/users", (req, res) => …)` is the
unit `GET /users`), which are measured apart from the function that mounts
them.

```bash
itos-cc crap --top 20             # runs the tests with coverage first
itos-cc crap --use-existing-coverage
itos-cc dry --changed             # changed files against the whole project
itos-cc mutate src/billing/invoice.ts
itos-cc scrap --verbose
```

### crap

`CRAP = CC² × (1 − coverage)³ + CC`. Coverage comes from each language's own
tools, run per build root: `go test -coverprofile`, Vitest, Jest, or c8
(LCOV), coverage.py (LCOV), and JaCoCo or Kover XML for Kotlin. Bring your own
with `--coverage-command` and `--coverage-report`; several reports are
combined, and code that more than one report or Go test binary lists counts
once, covered if any of them ran it.

A function with branches in the report is scored by the share of branches it
took (LCOV `BRDA` blocks with two or more arms, JaCoCo branch counters,
coverage.py with `--branch`); one without is scored by its lines. Go
profiles have no branches, so Go is scored by statements. c8's LCOV lists V8
blocks rather than branches, so a project with neither Vitest nor Jest falls
back to lines. Only the current Vitest major (5) is supported; older ones
are reported and left unmeasured. Python and TypeScript coverage is measured from the first line
of the body, because loading a module executes every `def` and
`export const f = …` line.

### dry

Local names, field names, and literals are normalized away; called function
names, operators, and the tree's shape stay. Functions are compared by the
Jaccard similarity of their subtree fingerprints. The default threshold is
0.82.

### mutate

Swaps operators (`<`/`<=`, `==`/`!=`, `&&`/`||`, `+`/`-`, …), deletes `!` and
unary `-`, and flips `true`/`false` and `0`/`1`, one at a time, inside
functions only. What keeps it fast:

- **Differential runs.** Each function's source is hashed. Killed mutants of
  unchanged functions stay killed; survivors and changed functions rerun.
- **Coverage first.** Mutants on lines no test executes are reported as
  uncovered and never run.
- **Narrow, fail-fast test runs.** The file's own Go package
  (`-failfast`), `vitest related` / `jest --findRelatedTests`, `pytest -x`.
- **Parallel workers** in private copies of the project, so the real tree is
  never modified while tests run. The baseline runs inside a worker, which
  proves the copy works before any mutant does.

Results go to `.metrics/mutate/<file>.json`, and a summary comment is kept at
the end of each source file (`--no-annotate` turns it off). Exit codes: 0 all
killed, 2 a baseline failed, 3 a mutant survived.

### scrap

Finds the test cases of Vitest/Jest, pytest/unittest, Go `testing`
(including `t.Run` and table loops), and JUnit/kotest, and scores each one on
size (fixture text excluded), logic, mocking, and assertions (helpers that
assert count as assertions). Similar examples are clustered with dry's
fingerprints. Each file gets one action: `LEAVE_ALONE`, `AUTO_TABLE_DRIVE`,
`AUTO_REFACTOR`, `MANUAL_SPLIT`, or `REVIEW_FIRST`, plus ranked
recommendations with line ranges. Every run is compared with the previous
snapshot, so rerunning after a refactor says whether it helped.

## The architecture viewer

`itos-cc serve` watches one or more repositories and publishes their
architecture over HTTP; `viewer/` is a separate web app (TypeScript, React,
React Flow, ELK) that draws it as a canvas you drill into: repositories →
directories → modules → functions.

```bash
itos-cc serve . ../other-repo          # API on http://127.0.0.1:7070
cd viewer && npm install && npm run dev # viewer on http://localhost:5173

# or serve a built viewer from the same port
(cd viewer && npm run build) && itos-cc serve --ui viewer/dist .
```

- A module is a file in TypeScript, Python, and Kotlin, and a package in Go.
  Directories with a single child collapse into one box, so a deep
  `src/main/kotlin/com/acme` tree is one click, not five.
- Solid arrows are imports, rolled up to the boxes on the current level;
  boxes sit above what they depend on. Arrows in a dependency cycle are red at
  every level. Kotlin dependencies within a package count even without an
  import, and Python's `importlib.import_module("x")` counts as an import.
- Dashed arrows are HTTP: a request (`fetch`, `EventSource`, axios,
  `requests`, `httpx`, `http.Get`, RestTemplate, WebClient, Ktor client)
  whose path matches a route another module serves (`net/http`, chi, gin,
  echo, Express, Fastify, Hono, Flask, FastAPI, Spring, Ktor). Matching runs
  across every repository served together, so a frontend in one repository
  points at the service it calls in another. Requests whose path is all
  parameters, such as `${base}/${path}`, are too vague to place and are
  skipped.
- Box color runs from red to green and combines CRAP with the mutation
  score; grey means not measured yet. A module is as risky as its worst
  function. A directory or repository is graded by the share of its functions
  that are risky, and by its overall kill rate, so one bad file does not
  paint a whole system red. The bar under each box splits its functions into
  risky, worth a look, low risk, and unmeasured. `mut 100% · 6/53` means every
  mutant run was killed, in the 6 of 53 functions mutation-tested so far.
- TypeScript imports through `tsconfig.json` aliases (`paths`, `baseUrl`,
  `extends`, and Vite-style `references`) resolve to project files.
- Saving a file updates complexity, dependencies, and CRAP (live complexity
  with the last measured coverage) within a second. Rerunning `crap`,
  `mutate`, or `dry` updates their numbers. Functions edited since their last
  mutation run are marked stale.
- Click a box for its functions, a function for its source, an arrow for the
  imports behind it. Double-click or Enter opens a box; Esc goes up.

API: `GET /api/graph` (JSON), `GET /api/events` (server-sent events carrying
the graph version), `GET /api/source?repo=&file=` (only files in the graph).
The server listens on localhost only.

## .metrics

Every command writes a JSON snapshot under `.metrics/`: `crap.json`,
`dry.json`, `scrap.json`, and `mutate/`. Commit them: a clone then has the
numbers without rerunning, and mutation results are shared, so nobody reruns
mutants that are already killed. Snapshots carry no timestamps and are
sorted, so an unchanged result is an unchanged file. Raw coverage reports go
to `.metrics/coverage/`, which ignores itself.

## Layout

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `lang` | Parsing, units (functions and methods), namespaces, complexity, and each language's syntax and mutation rules |
| `project` | Finding source and test files |
| `coverage` | Running coverage and reading LCOV, Go profiles, and JaCoCo |
| `crap`, `dry`, `mutate`, `scrap` | The tools |
| `metrics` | Snapshot files |
| `graph`, `server` | The architecture graph and its live HTTP API |
| `cmd/itos-cc` | The command line |
| `viewer/` | The web viewer, a separate npm project |

Adding a language means one file in `lang/` (grammar, units, decisions,
syntax, mutation rules), test-framework rules in `scrap/`, and a coverage
plan in `coverage/`.
