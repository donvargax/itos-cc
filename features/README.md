# Feature files

Every `feat:` and `fix:` commit of this project is driven by scenarios in this folder.
Nothing else belongs here. The harness is harvested from itos's
(github.com/donvargax/itos, `features/`) and itos-template's, without either one's own
generator behaviour.

## What goes in a feature file

Only behaviour a user of the project can observe: what a command does to a folder, its exit
code, and what it prints.

Never here:

- code structure, dead code, dependencies, formatting (`gofmt`, `go vet`, golangci-lint,
  govulncheck);
- refactors and performance budgets (tasks in `tasks/`);
- internal logic (unit tests, next to the code).

## Black-box boundary

The steps (`*_test.go`, Go, run by [godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog)) treat the binary as
a black box. `TestFeatures` builds it once a run from this tree (`itos-cc.exe` on
Windows), stamped with a known version and commit, as a release's build is stamped with the
release's. Each scenario gets a scratch folder in a temporary directory, runs the binary in it
and reads its exit code, its output and the files it leaves. A step judges the program by its
command line alone: it never reads its source or calls its code to decide a result.

Commands run in a clean environment: no `GIT_*`, `ITOS_*`, `ITOS_CC_*`, `GITHUB_*`,
`GH_*` or `CI` variable of the caller's, no global or system git config, a fixed author, and none
of the caller's claude, itos or its extensions on the PATH. A `GOCOVERDIR` that exists builds the
binary with `-cover` and collects what each run did, for itos-cc to merge with `go test`'s.

An interrupt is sent as each system delivers Ctrl-C, from one build-tagged file per system:
`os.Interrupt` on Linux and macOS, and on Windows `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` to the binary started in a
process group of its own, which Go reports as the same signal. The step first writes more to the
binary's open stdin than any pipe holds unread, so the write returns only once the binary is
reading, its interrupt handling already in place; no sleep guesses when. A run the interrupt
killed by the system's default action fails the step: it never handled the interrupt.

## Running them

```sh
go test ./features -count=1                          # every live scenario
go test ./features -count=1 -scenarios='^@ID-CLI-'   # the live scenarios with a matching tag
GOCOVERDIR=$d go test ./features -count=1            # built with -cover, its coverage in $d
itos tests smoke run scenario                        # exactly the smoke set
```

`-scenarios` takes a regular expression over each tag, `@` included. It exists because godog's
own tag filter takes exact tags joined by commas, while itos merges selections into one regular
expression joined by `|`. One that matches no tag fails the run, so a selection never passes by
running nothing. Each scenario is a subtest of `TestFeatures`, named after the scenario.

## Tags

| Tag               | Meaning                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@phase-<n>`      | The phase a scenario belongs to.                                                     |
| `@<item>`         | The work item that turns it green (`@count-cli`).                                     |
| `@ID-<AREA>-<nn>` | Stable scenario ID. Commits reference these. Never reuse or renumber them.           |
| `@bug-<n>`        | Reproduces a fixed bug. Added by `fix:` commits.                                     |
| `@wip`            | Written, not yet implemented. Excluded from every run, and a `feat` may not name it. |

**IDs.** `<AREA>` is one word in capitals for the area of behaviour, and one feature file holds
one area: `COUNT` is `count.feature`, `CLI` is `cli.feature`, `COMPL` is `completion.feature`.
`<nn>` counts up within the area from `01`; a removed scenario's number is not given again. A new
area gets a new word and a new file.

## Commit rules

- `feat:` must add or change scenarios, or reference `@wip` ones it turns green. Footer:
  `Scenarios: ID-COUNT-01` (`itos commit --scenarios`).
- `fix:` must add a `@bug-<n>` scenario that failed before the fix, or reference an existing
  scenario that was failing. Same footer.
- The commit-msg hook checks that the referenced IDs exist and are live at the commit.
- Red first: a slice's steps go alone in a `test` commit, its scenarios still `@wip`
  (`itos commit --item count-cli`).

## The smoke set

The smoke set is the list in `smoke.yaml`: the scenarios every push runs, beside the ones its
commits name. The rule, which `itos tests smoke check scenario` checks:

- **Every feature file with a live scenario has at least one smoke scenario**, listed under the
  file with the reason it was chosen. A file has more only when the list says why (`more`).
- Every ID in the list is a live scenario of the file it is listed under.
- A smoke scenario is fast and central to its file.

So a `feat` that adds a feature file, or makes a `@wip` one live, picks its smoke scenario in the
same commit.

## Writing a scenario

- **Give a check its own wording.** godog matches a step's text whatever its keyword, so a `Then`
  phrased like an existing `Given` runs the setter and cannot fail.
- **A step is one line**, however long.
- **Assert what a user reads**: the exit code, a sentence of the output. Never more of the output
  than the behaviour is about.
- **Never start a description line with `@`.** Gherkin reads it as tags, and godog then refuses
  the file, failing every run of the features.
- **Say why beside the scenario** when a setup would make a reader ask: a comment above the tag
  line.

## The steps this project's scenarios use

These are the ones the harness must define. Each is a regular expression over the step's text,
with the program named as the built binary is.

| Step                                                                                  | What it asserts                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `itos-cc runs with "…"`                                                       | Runs the binary in the scratch folder with those words.          |
| `itos-cc runs with "…" and the environment "NAME=value"`                     | The same, with that variable added to the clean environment.     |
| `itos-cc runs with "…" and its standard input left open`                     | Starts the binary, its stdin a pipe held open, and does not wait. |
| `it is interrupted while it waits`                                                    | Interrupts that run once it reads its stdin; waits for it to stop. |
| `it exits with code <n>`                                                              | The binary's exit status.                                         |
| `its standard output says "…"` / `does not say "…"` / `lists "…"` / `does not list "…"` | Containment, or one whole line equal to the text.                |
| `its standard output is empty`                                                        | Nothing at all on stdout.                                        |
| `its error output says "…"` / `does not say "…"`                                      | The same, on stderr.                                              |
| `the first line of its standard output is "…" and the stamped version`                | The stamped version the harness built with.                      |
| `the second line of its standard output is "…" and the stamped commit`                | The stamped commit.                                               |
| `the last line of its standard output is "…"`                                          | The completion protocol's instruction line.                       |
| `its JSON output names the problem "…"`                                               | That the object lists a problem with that rule.                  |
| `its JSON output gives file "…", <n> lines and <n> words`                             | The success object's file, lines and words.                      |
| `its JSON output gives each problem a rule, a message and a fix`                      | That no problem is missing one of the three.                     |
| `its JSON output gives the stamped version and commit`                                | version's object: schema 1, ok, the stamped version and commit.  |
| `its standard output is one line`                                                     | Exactly one line, as `--json` prints its object.                 |
| `the file "…" contains "…", "…"`                                                      | Each text is in the file.                                         |
| `the file "…" holds a line of <n> characters`                                         | A file written for the scenario, long enough to beat a token limit. |
| `standard input holds "…"`                                                            | The text the run reads from its standard input.                   |
| `an empty folder "…"`                                                                 | A folder in the scratch directory.                                |
