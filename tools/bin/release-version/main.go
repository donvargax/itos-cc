// Command release-version computes the version the next release carries from
// the commits since the last one: the tag is the version, and nothing in the
// tree holds one. Harvested with the owner's permission (CONTRIBUTORS.md) from
// itos-template's tools/bin/release-version (its T-5), which took it from
// itos's (its T-069 and T-089); the rule of what the binary is built from is
// itos-template's own (its T-15), retargeted to this module and its binary.
//
// The last release is the newest vX.Y.Z tag reachable from HEAD, by its
// numbers, picked by internal/release (Newest); the commits are <tag>..HEAD,
// so nothing before the tag counts. Of those:
//
//   - any commit marked as breaking (a ! before its header's colon, of any
//     type, or a BREAKING-CHANGE: or BREAKING CHANGE: footer in its message's
//     last paragraph) makes a major;
//   - else a feat makes a minor;
//   - else a fix makes a patch;
//   - else a patch when the binary is built from something else than the
//     last release was: the modules ./cmd/itos-cc links, or the Go
//     toolchain that builds it (itos-template's decision 23);
//   - else nothing is released: nothing a user can feel changed.
//
// The fourth rule is there because a dependency update (Renovate's) is
// a build commit, which would otherwise release nothing: a security fix in a
// module the binary links, or in Go's standard library, which every binary
// links and the toolchain brings, would reach no user until the next feat or
// fix. internal/release's BinaryMoved reads each side from a copy of that
// commit's tree (git archive into a temporary folder, the working tree never
// touched): the modules are what go list -deps lists for ./cmd/itos-cc
// on each system the release builds for (.goreleaser.yaml's goos), each
// package's module path and version, a replacement's after it, the main
// module left out; the toolchain is go.mod's toolchain line, else its go
// line, as go mod edit -json reads them. What leaves the binary as it was
// releases nothing: a module only tests import (godog, rapid), a tool of
// go.mod's tool block (govulncheck), a go.sum-only change, a required module
// the binary never links, a workflow's action. Its Moved says what moved, and
// the line on stderr names each module (its old and new version) or the
// toolchain, so the release's run shows why; tools/bin/release-notes names
// them from the same, in the notes' opening line. go list needs the modules
// of both commits: the module cache, or the network to the module proxy, as
// the release job has (actions/setup-go runs before it). With no tag the
// rule does not run: the first release still needs a feat.
//
// With no such tag the last version is 0.0.0, every commit counting, so the
// first release is v0.1.0 when the history holds a feat. A shallow clone,
// which may hide the tag or the commits, stops it with exit 2, never a guess.
//
// A version is refused (exit 1, nothing on stdout) when its major does not
// match the module path of HEAD's go.mod, as itos's T-089 refuses it: from v2
// Go's module proxy takes a vN.x.y tag only from a module whose path ends in
// /vN, and a v0 or v1 tag only from one with no such suffix, so a release cut
// from a mismatched go.mod could never be go-installed (itos cut v3.0.0 to
// v3.3.0 from a path ending in /v2). The path moves first, in its own
// commits, and the release follows. A HEAD without a go.mod has no path to
// contradict.
//
// It prints key=value lines, which the release workflow appends to
// $GITHUB_OUTPUT as they are:
//
//	last=v0.1.0      the last release's tag, empty with none
//	next=0.2.0       the version to release, empty when nothing is releasable
//	bump=minor       major, minor, patch or none
//	range=v0.1.0..HEAD
//
// and on stderr one line saying why. A commit is read by internal/release
// (Type and Breaking), the last release is picked there too (Newest), and
// what moved beneath the binary is read there (BinaryMoved); beside it,
// release-version imports only the standard library, and runs git.
//
//	go run ./tools/bin/release-version
//
// Exit status: 0 computed (next may be empty), 1 the version is refused, 2 it
// could not read the history, go.mod or what the binary is built from.
